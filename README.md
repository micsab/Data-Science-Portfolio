# Michael Sabol's Data Science Portfolio
## Welcome

Welcome to my data science portfolio!  In the folders above are various data science projects that showcase my skills exploring, visualizing, analyzing, and modeling data.  Below is a brief description of the various projects I've worked on.  You can find more detail in each respective folder.

### [Video Game Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/micsab/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/game_recommendation_engine)
__Overview:__ New video games are released with startling frequency. But with this over-abundance of choice comes a new problem... analysis paralysis. "Do I buy that hot new game that just came out? What about that other new hot game that came out or that older game that everyone said was great? Hell, maybe I should just play one of the games I already bought but never installed?‚Äù  The aim of this project was to build a recommendation engine that recommends you not just available games, but will also games that are already in your library but unplayed. Yay for saving money!

__Skills Showcased:__ NLP,EDA, Web Scraping, NLP, A/B Testing, Summarization of Results

### [NBA MVP Prediction](https://github.com/micsab/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/nba_mvp_prediction)
__Overview:__ Can stats predict who will win the NBA MVP award? Let's find out! This project attempts to answer that along with what features (statistics) are most important in determining who has the highest liklihood of becoming MVP in any given season.

__Skills Showcased:__ EDA, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Model Selection, HyperParameter Tuning, Results Summarization
