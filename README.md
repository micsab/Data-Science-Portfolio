# Michael Sabol's Data Science Portfolio
## Welcome

Welcome to my data science portfolio!  In the folders above are various data science projects that showcase my skills exploring, visualizing, analyzing, and modeling data.  Below is a brief description of the various projects I've worked on.  You can find more detail in each respective folder.

### [Video Game Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/micsab/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/game_recommendation_engine)
__Overview:__ New video games are released with startling frequency. But with this over-abundance of choice comes a new problem... analysis paralysis. "Do I buy that hot new game that just came out? What about that other new hot game that came out or that older game that everyone said was great? Hell, maybe I should just play one of the games I already bought but never installed?‚Äù  The aim of this project was to build a recommendation engine that recommends you not just available games, but will also games that are already in your library but unplayed. Yay for saving money!

__Skills Showcased:__ NLP,EDA, Web Scraping, NLP, A/B Testing, Summarization of Results
